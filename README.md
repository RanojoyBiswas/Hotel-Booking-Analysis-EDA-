<p id="description">In this project we are going to perform exploratory data analysis on Hotel Booking data. We are given a data in csv format which has information about bookings of resorts and city hotels. The data contains many different variety of features and attributes. The data is from a wide demography covering multiple nations. This data set contains booking information for a city hotel and a resort hotel and includes information such as when the booking was made length of stay the number of adults children and/or babies and the number of available parking spaces among other things. We are required to perform the right analysis on the data and come up with suggestions and insights that can be useful for the hotel business as well as helpful for the guests and families who are renting the hotel rooms. We need to figure out which kind of metric to use which kind of relationships are present in the features where the businesses are lagging behind which are the areas to improve etc.</p>
